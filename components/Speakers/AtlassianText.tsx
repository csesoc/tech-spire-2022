        Ofir&apos;s experience expands beyond the conventional career path of a
        Software Engineer. From his Network Engineering internship at Google to
        his current role as a Product Manager at Atlassian, he has developed a
        deep understanding of the tech industry.

        Some older students might know Ofir as CSESoc&apos;s 2018 Co-President
        where he was chosen for the Engineering Student Service Leadership
        Award. Others might know him as their camp leader, or from the weekly
        barbecues where he manned the grill.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether or not you know him, if you have used JIRA, you have likely
        interacted with one of his features.
