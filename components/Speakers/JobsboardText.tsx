        Founded in 2018 by Adam Tizzone, Jobsboard has played a crucial role in
        kickstarting the careers of many CSESoc students. It has scraped by in
        maintenance mode until this year, where a new team lead by Darian and
        Joanna aimed to completely revamp the project.

      <p>
        With a modern UI, sponsor integrations, international support and more
        to come, the future careers of CSESoc students are in bright hands. Come
        listen to their journey and get a sneak peek before the release!
