        Just a few years into his career, Adam has already built an impressive
        track record. Upon graduating from UNSW in 2019, he made his way to
        Washington as a full-time Software Engineer for Microsoft. Recently, he
        returned to Sydney to continue his story at Australia&apos;s most
        renowned start-up.

        During his time at university, Adam was heavily involved in various
        extra-cirriculars including CSESoc where he would eventually become the
        2017 Co-President. It is also rumoured that he founded CSESoc Projects
        where he kickstarted many teams including the soon to be unveiled
        Jobsboard.

        He is extremely passionate about music, having helped direct multiple
        revues for different societies. When he is away from his desk, you might
        find him playing -INSTRUMENT- at the Hornsby Gangshow.
